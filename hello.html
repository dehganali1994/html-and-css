<pre id="fiio"><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
It can be assisted by technologies such as <mark>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</mark> and <u>scripting languages</u> such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page.
Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</pre></div><hr>

    <ul><li>XHTML 1.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on January 25, 2000,[57] and was later revised and republished on August 1, 2002. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions.</li>
    <li>XHTML 1.1[58] was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2002. It is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but includes minor changes, can be customized, and is reformulated using modules in the W3C recommendation "Modularization of XHTML", which was published on April 10, 2001</li>
    <li>XHTML 2.0 was a working draft, work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on HTML5 and XHTML5.XHTML 2.0 was incompatible with XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be more accurately characterized as an XHTML-inspired new language than an update to XHTML 1.x.</li>
    <li>An XHTML syntax, known as "XHTML5.1", is being defined alongside HTML5 in the HTML5 draft.</li>
